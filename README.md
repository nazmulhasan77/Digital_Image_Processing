# Digital Image Processing

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for basic digital image processing tasks such as loading an RGB image, extracting its color channels, and generating a negative image using the `matplotlib` library. The project aims to provide foundational understanding of image representation and manipulation using Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

### 1. Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Verify installation:

```bash
python --version
````

---

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies separately.

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages

Install dependencies using `pip`:


If you want to install **all commonly used Python libraries for Digital Image Processing (DIP)** including `matplotlib`, here‚Äôs a typical list and the pip command to install them all at once:

---

### Common DIP libraries:

* `matplotlib` ‚Äî visualization and plotting
* `numpy` ‚Äî numerical computing (arrays, matrices)
* `opencv-python` ‚Äî OpenCV for advanced image processing
* `scikit-image` ‚Äî image processing algorithms
* `Pillow` ‚Äî image loading, saving, and basic manipulation
* `imageio` ‚Äî image input/output

---
### Install all at once:

```bash
pip install matplotlib numpy opencv-python scikit-image Pillow imageio
```
