# Digital Image Processing

## üìå Project Overview

This repository contains Python scripts for basic digital image processing tasks such as loading an RGB image, extracting its color channels, and generating a negative image using the `matplotlib` library. The project aims to provide foundational understanding of image representation and manipulation using Python.

## üõ†Ô∏è Environment Setup

### 1. Install Python

Make sure you have **Python 3.7+** installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Verify installation:

```bash
python --version
````

---

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)

Creating a virtual environment helps manage dependencies separately.

```bash
# On macOS/Linux
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Required Packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### üîç What Each Library Is For:

| Library           | Purpose                                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **matplotlib**    | Plotting and visualizing images and graphs                          |
| **numpy**         | Array operations and matrix math (core to image data manipulation)  |
| **pandas**        | Data analysis and table-style data management (optional but useful) |
| **opencv-python** | Advanced image processing and computer vision algorithms            |
| **scikit-image**  | High-level image processing functions and filters                   |
| **Pillow**        | Simple image file I/O (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.) and basic editing      |
| **imageio**       | Image input/output for multiple formats including GIF, TIFF, etc.   |
